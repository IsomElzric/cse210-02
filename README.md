# Hilo
A simple game where your reason and a little luck come together to ask one single question. How high can you get? In Hilo you draw a card and decide whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the one you have. If you guess correct you'll gain 100 points. Guess wrong however, and you'll lose 75. You begin the game with 300 so nothing is stopping you from taking a little risk, just don't reach 0 or the game is over!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.9.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 hilo 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
